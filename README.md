# image_sharpness_frequency_domain
This notebook will present a methodology to quantify image sharpness using the frequency domain of the image. With varying focus positions or different focal lengths, different parts of an image are being focused, resulting in highlighting certain frequencies at a time while making the rest blurred. This method will highlight sharp features only.
